  <p>This is one of the most prestegious collections of classic cars, supercars, and all around oddities.</p>
  <p>From steam power to biodiesel, electric to pure American V8 power, and even a clown car or two, there is something for everyone to enjoy.</p>
  <p>The collection is currently worth over $52 million and is located in a secured building next to the Burbank Airport in California.</p>

  <p>Thanks to my fake app, now you have the opportunity to (pretend to) rent one of these beauties for the day!</p>
  <p>Please be very careful when driving as these vehicles are irreplaceable.</p>
  <p>Every car comes with an <strong>Insurance Claim Form</strong> in case you are involved in an accident.</p>
